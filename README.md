-  **API Key Management**: Support for both .env file and manual GROQ API key entry

##  Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MySQL Server
- GROQ API Key (Get one from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/))

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-chat.git
cd sql-chat
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your GROQ API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

##  Configuration

1. Start your MySQL server
2. Launch the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
3. In the sidebar:
   - Enter your GROQ API key (if not in .env file)
   - Fill in your MySQL connection details:
     - Hostname (default: localhost)
     - Port (default: 3306)
     - Username
     - Password
     - Database Name
4. Click "Connect" to establish the database connection

##  Usage

1. Once connected, you can start asking questions about your database in natural language
2. The AI will:
   - Convert your question to SQL
   - Execute the query
   - Provide a natural language response with the results
3. The conversation history is maintained for context
4. Use the sidebar to:
   - Monitor connection status
   - Disconnect from the database
   - Reset the application
   - View available tables
